# The Rapid Reservoir-River Temperature Assessment Model (R3TAM)

This is a collection of documents that describe the components of the Rapid Resevoir-River Temperature Assessment Model (R3TAM) framework and present examples of its usage in the Shasta-Keswick-Sacramento River system in California.

The R3TAM framework is flexible and may evolve as it is tested in various applications.
This site is intended to be a central location to collect documentation and reference material developed as the models are used. 
Check back for updates!


The contents of this documentation are organized into three main sections.

  *  Discussion: The first is a discussion of the concepts and motivation behind the R3TAM framework. (*under development*)
  *  Reference: The second provides detailed descriptions of the model components, including the equations used and their representation and organization in the model code. (*under development*)
  * Tutorial: The third provides several tutorials that demonstrate the use of the R3TAM models in a standalone and coupled application.
